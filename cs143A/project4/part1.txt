Mutal exclusion, progress, no starvation and efficent. Essentially, the critical section needs to be
an area of code that will finish, and only allow one thread in. Mutal exclusion, mutex, means only one
thread enters the critical section. Progress means that something can eventually leave the critical section (for example releasing a lock). Starvation shouldn't happen because then another thread can't enter
the critical section. The critical section should also be pretty fast, at least fast enough where it
doesn't take forever for one thread to finish.
