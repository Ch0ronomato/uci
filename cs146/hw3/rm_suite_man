NAME:
    srm [OPTIONS] [FILES]...
    unrm [FILES]
    lsrm
    durm
    trash
NOTES:
    These five commands represent a suite of safe rm commands. 

    srm:
        Safe removal of all files. Any file srm'd will be moved to a $TRASH directory.
        The $TRASH variable can either be defined as an enviorment variable, or a default
        path of ~/.Trash will be used. If any flags are provided to srm, then normal rm
        will be executed.

    unrm:
        Undelete a file that has been srm'd. unrm will move the file in the $TRASH into
        the CURRENT directory, not the directory that srm was originally called in. Any 
        duplicate file will simply be deleted from the trash directory.

    lsrm:
        Performs an ls -lS on the $TRASH directory.

    durm:
        Performs a du -hc on the $TRASH 

    trash:
        Moves all files in the $TRASH directory to the current directory. It is basically the
        same as unrm *
