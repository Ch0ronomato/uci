LSS(1)                  MAN
NAME:
    lss - long, byte sorted, file names only ls
SYNOPSIS:
    lss [OPTIONS] [FILES] ...
OPTIONS:
    lss is an extension of ls. It will always call ls underneath, 
    and then grep the output to ensure only files are shown. Most
    flags that are on ls are supported here. There are few that
    are not due too conflicts with either the sort or grep's expected
    output.

    These are the unsupported flags
		s)
            Prints out filesize at the beginning. This
            messes up our expected ls -l output
		i) 
            Same as above, expect the inode number
            instead of the filesize
		g)
            g is ignored because it will mess up our
            output.
		f)
            The t flag will tell ls to not sort, which
            is not what we want, we need to sort by
            file size.
		C)
            C is another method to sort, overriding S  
		X)
            X will do something similar to C, but 
            sorting by time.
		d)
            The d flag shows only directories.
		m)
            m will cause all files to be comma
            seperated, messing up our output.
        t)
            t will attempted to sort by timestamp  
        u)
            u will attempt to modify the sort by 
            another flag.
        v)
            v will use natural sort. Not what we want  
        U)
            U tells ls to not sort at all
